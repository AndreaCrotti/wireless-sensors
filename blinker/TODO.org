* Set up the mailing list
* Set up the hook in github
* Test the TOSSIM live (remove the power setting if necessary)
* Set up a correct DEBUG struct in Blink.h and see how to handle it
* See if better to rename msg/newmsg stuff into less confusing names
  
* Using the *getrsi* call it's probably necessary also to use the given protocol
  - I can just take every possible beacon and try to set the parent accordingly
  - I can just don't care about the arrival time now, since I can simply every time grab a beacon and see if it's good or not

* What is the default key for?
* Use @safe if possible and see possible usages

* See tos.interfaces.PacketLink interface to setup the correct number of retries and so on
* See how to configure [[http://docs.tinyos.net/index.php/Setting_up_TUnit][Tunit]] and [[http://docs.tinyos.net/index.php/Multi-Node_Unit_Testing][Multi node testing]]
* See if possible to create a QUEUE of packets, maybe a separate module below the reliability module
* See why from node 13 it's not working anymore
* Define a language for defining tests, something like
  - TOPO = ...
  - PRE1 = ... (do something before test1)
  - TEST1 = ... (give a triple to test)
  - AFTER1 = ... (do something else after)
  - and so on

* See if it's better to use the default LogWriter or some home made arrays and pointers for it
